Roadmap:

To be implemented:

Runge-Kutta iteration
Description: implement the higher-order function that performs
an iteration of runge-kutta given a position, a current time, a timestep
and a function that represents the derivative of the function we are
attempting to approximate [should work for an arbitrary # of arguments]

Functions for the derivative
Description: implement the whatchamacallit function we're supposed to use

Business logic
Description: the "put everything together" part of things
